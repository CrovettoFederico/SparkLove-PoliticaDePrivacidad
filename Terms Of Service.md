Terms of Service

Last updated: 2026-03-01

Welcome to Spark Love (the “App”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the App.

By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1. Description of the Service

The App is a digital platform designed for couples, offering interactive features, daily experiences, and relationship-oriented content.

The App provides certain features free of charge. Additional features may be made available through one-time in-app purchases.

2. In-App Purchases

The App may offer digital purchases that unlock, enable, or expand specific features within the App.

Each in-app purchase:

Is a one-time transaction

Unlocks or extends specific features as described within the App at the time of purchase

Is non-transferable

Does not constitute a subscription

Does not involve recurring charges

The specific features enabled by a purchase may vary depending on the product description shown at the time of purchase.

The App reserves the right to introduce additional in-app purchases in the future, each associated with different features or expansions.

3. Feature Expansion and Modifications

In-app purchases unlock or expand certain functionality available within the App.

We reserve the right to:

Modify, improve, expand, or adjust unlocked features

Introduce new purchasable expansions

Refine how existing features operate

Purchases grant access to the unlocked functionality as defined by the App’s current structure. They do not guarantee the permanent availability of any exact implementation, layout, or feature detail.

4. Association of Purchases to a Couple

Certain in-app purchases are associated with a specific couple connection within the App.

This means:

When a purchase is made within a couple pairing, the unlocked features apply to that specific couple connection.

If the couple disconnects, separates, or removes the pairing inside the App, access to those unlocked features for that pairing is terminated.

If either user forms a new couple connection, previously unlocked features do not automatically transfer.

A new purchase may be required for a new couple pairing.

Purchases associated with a couple are tied to the relationship state within the App, not permanently to an individual user account.

5. Payments

All payments are processed through Google Play.

By completing a purchase, you agree to Google Play’s terms and policies.

The App does not process payments directly and does not store payment information.

Prices are displayed before purchase confirmation and may vary depending on region, taxes, or local pricing policies applied by Google Play.

6. Refunds

Refunds are handled exclusively by Google Play according to their refund policy.

The App does not issue direct refunds.

If a refund is granted by Google Play, the corresponding unlocked features may be revoked.

7. Account Responsibility

You are responsible for:

Maintaining access to your Google account

Ensuring your couple connection reflects your intended relationship status

Using the App in accordance with applicable laws

We are not responsible for loss of unlocked features resulting from:

Voluntary disconnection of a couple

Account deletion

Violation of these Terms

Refunds processed by Google Play

8. Limitation of Liability

The App is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:

Indirect or consequential damages

Loss of relationship data due to user actions

Service interruptions caused by third-party platforms (including Google Play)

9. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App if a user violates these Terms.

Access to purchased features may be revoked in cases of policy violations or fraudulent activity.

10. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where the App operator is established, without regard to conflict of law principles.
